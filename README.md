This project was served to as a proof-of-concept for a potential client. The Bahart Bill Pay APIs uses XML but these APIs receive JSON - there is an XML to JSON conversion. 
The user can fetch their bill depending on the id they provide (Phone number, Biller Id and Customer Id).
The user can then pay that bill and have it removed from the database.
